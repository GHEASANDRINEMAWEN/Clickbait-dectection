# Clickbait-dectection


Fine-Tuning BERT for Clickbait Detection
This project involves fine-tuning BERT-based classifiers to detect clickbait titles. The goal is to experiment with different classifier configurations, log results using Weights & Biases (wandb), and perform an error analysis.

Overview
Task: Classify headlines as clickbait or non-clickbait.

Model: Fine-tuned BERT variants for text classification.

Evaluation: Record results using wandb and analyze errors.
